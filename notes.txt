ok now can you show me the entirety of both app py and dashboard html after the changes. Dashboard.html should be updated to include a table showing the mg test information, including when it was made, and what the value was, this value should be persistent, meaning it should stay visible in the gui even after a pi restart. It should show up to the last 5 tests, so for example, If I did a test 3 days ago with a reading of 1350, it should still show up today,  as well as up to the 4 previous test prior to it. also update app.py to handle this. it should include the changes nessecary to take a picture with the pi camera, get the rgb value of an average of a few pixels near the center of the image(which i think the pi camera is 1080p), then convert that to an mg reading, then display that on the dashboard. the gui should also keep all of the current functionality of turning on and off pumps and indicator lights and stuff. make sure that the whole this is perfect and will work. I do not want any ERR_NGROK_3200
The endpoint 9e24-206-166-196-58.ngrok-free.app is offline. errors. 

ok so the more blue sample meaning that there the mg was low, signifying about an 1100 mg level  rgb value was about (14, 77, 177), and the more pink sample, indicating the higher mg level, around 1500, is about (240, 56, 127), so assuming a linear change in color based on mg level, for example, mg of about 1300 should be a pretty purpleish color of about (127, 67, 152)
